# Personal Server Ansible
I'm setting up a home server and wanted to implement an ansible setup to quickly get it running, especially as I like to periodically reset to keep things clean and fast.

My personal documentation is done in [Obsidian - Sharpen your thinking](https://obsidian.md/) but I will do my best to update it in here (or a personal wiki as is my hope to self host)

But first I started with the Ansible Community Documentation Quickstart and documented my notes in [Quickstart Notes](./documentation/quickstart.md)
